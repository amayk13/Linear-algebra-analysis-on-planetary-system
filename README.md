# Project: Mapping pluto's orbit and analyzing perturbations

- Created data points using NASAâ€™s data set on Heliocentric Trajectories for Selected Spacecraft, Planets, and Comets.
- Efficient code with 65+ lines and employed rigorous Singular Value Decomposition and eigen decomposition algorithms.
- Orbit equation was mapped with 99%+ accuracy.
- Orbit equation was mapped with 94%+ accuracy for perturbed data points.
